DESCRIPTION:
This project uses Linear Programming (LP) to solve a business decision-making problem. The scenario is simple but powerful: a factory produces two types of products, each requiring machine time and labor hours. Since resources are limited, the goal is to find the best combination of products that will maximize total profit without exceeding those limits. To do this, we use the PuLP library in Python, which makes it easy to define and solve optimization problems. The logic and results are all shown in a Jupyter Notebook, including a graph to visualize the best solution. This project is a great example of how optimization techniques can be applied in real-life business settings to make smarter, more profitable decisions.
